## Dependencies

### Software

* The project was developed on Windows 10 using KiCad 6.0
* The libraries for the footprints and 3D models are included under the "KiCAD Libraries" directory
* [Add symbol/footprint libraries to KiCad](https://support.snapeda.com/en/articles/5995733-how-to-import-into-kicad-v6-and-later)
* [Add 3D models to KiCad](https://support.snapeda.com/en/articles/3758108-how-to-import-a-3d-model-in-kicad)

### Hardware

* A 24V 1A power supply adapter is used to power up the speaker. A 24V 0.5A power supply adapter should also work with the possibility of lowering the performance
