## Dependencies

### Software

* The project was developed on Windows 10 using [KiCad 6.0](https://docs.kicad.org/6.0/)
* The libraries for the footprints and 3D models are included under the "KiCAD Libraries" directory. Might need to import them to the project.
* [Add symbol libraries to KiCad project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC3a5C4R820)
* [Add footprint libraries to KiCad project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBfGG5TKc6o)
* [Add 3D models to KiCad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqCzmXq5bb0)

### Hardware

* A 24V 1A power supply adapter is used to power up the speaker. A 24V 0.5A power supply adapter should also work with the possibility of lowering the performance
